          <h1>Introduction</h1>
    
          <p>
    The purpose of this document is to demonstrate that there are multiple
    interoperable implementations of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) that are capable of generating
    output that is conformant to the latest version.
          </p>

            <h2>Testing Methodology</h2>
    
            <p>
    The testing framework for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)  executes the
    following process for every conformance statement in the 
    <a href="https://github.com/w3c-dvcg/http-signatures-test-suite">
    Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)  specification</a> :
            </p>
    
            <ol class="algorithm">
              <li>
    Take an input that exercises the feature and feed it to a
    developer provided Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) binary.
              </li>
              <li>
    If the input is valid, generate a DID from the input.
              </li>
              <li>
    The test suite then ensures that the generated DID is
    conformant to the feature being tested.
              </li>
            </ol>
